I can't remember the exact date that I started using Linux, but it's been 20 years
sometime in early January. With some Christmas '95 money I bought a book at MediaPlay
that came with Slackware 2.3 (released 1995-05-10) on CD. The Wikipedia entry for [Slackware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slackware) claims 3.0 was the first version
to come on CD, but my bookshelf disagrees, and the book the CD came with was written
by Patrick Volkerding himself.

At the time I had my first computer of my own, which had a Cyrix Cx486DX2-80, 8MB RAM,
and a decent sized hard drive for the time; I'm thinking it was either 500MB or maybe
even 1GB. It came with DOS 6.22 and Windows 3.11 For Workgroups. I didn't have the
Microsoft install media (and I wouldn't be surprised if the store I bought it from
didn't have a valid license), so I feared formatting and used UMSDOS and Loadlin
to install and boot Linux on top of DOS and the FAT filesystem.

With my next computer I moved on to SuSE, which I stuck with through the 6.x and 7.x
versions. I took a couple year detour through BeOS, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD before
landing on Debian around 2004 with Woody (3.0). Eventually I got sick of how bad
Linux was on laptops (I've gathered it's improved immensely) and bought a PowerBook
G4 with MacOS X 10.3 (Unix on a laptop that works!) and have had a couple more Mac
desktops and laptops over the years (typing this on a 2012 MacBook Pro 15"), but
I've kept some sort of Debian box at work and/or home constantly.
